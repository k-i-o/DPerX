Welcome to **DPerX**! ðŸŽ‰

DPerX is an innovative external client originally developed by kio (Samuele Radici). This client is designed to be compatible with DDNet and the DDPER client. In 2024, we are excited to announce that DPerX is undergoing a significant modernization and overhaul to enhance its performance and user experience. ðŸš€
